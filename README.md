- Can read graph from files
- Can save graph in files
- Support *.bin* and *.txt* file formats
- Support Dijkstra, Floyd-Uorshell and Bellman-Ford algorithms

### Requirements

**To compile this GUI you need to link the Qt libraries and Boost Graph Library to run my algorithms!**

### Instruction

1. To use this GUI you should clone this repo
````git
git clone https://github.com/legGalaxyCode/sem2lab1gui.git
````
or download directly from GitHub

2. Then open it in Qt (or in another IDE) like a project use **.pro** file
3. Only that you need to do is write your own algrorithm functions in **model.cpp** and optionally delete my boost realisation


**It's open source so you can modify and use this GUI as you wanna. Thanks**
